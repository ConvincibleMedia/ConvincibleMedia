intro:

  paragraphs: Virgil Ierubino (Owner at Convincible) was the marketing brain behind
    the world’s most prestigious membership for teachers of English.
- item_type: block_body_text
  text: Teachers of English as a foreign language (TEFL) need new ideas, peer support
    and career guidance to excel at their work – and enjoy it even more. No professional
    membership could offer more prestige and expertise than one backed by the University
    of Cambridge – simply named Cambridge English Teacher.

  title: Becoming a major player overnight

  description: We needed to create a powerful brand that was recognisable and authoritative.
    The central element of this became colour. A deep green evoked relevance to the
    teaching profession – by analogy to chalkboards – as well as growth and new ideas.
    Continuous application of this colour, combined with the University link, allowed
    the membership to stand out from day one.

  description: All of the brand’s values were crystallised into a central marketing
    video. This was produced by an external animator according to the concept, storyboarding
    and script developed in-house. The video was used in presentations, on exhibition

    delivering numerous presentations (both informative and directly sales-related)
    communicating its advantages. Crisp, clean, visual slides, combined with a clear
    delivery style, ensured the message could be understood worldwide – even where
    English was not the audience’s first language.

  title: A stream of branded ideas
  link: 
  description: Social channels were an ideal way to develop a sense of community around
    the brand, and to spread awareness of it. Daily year-round campaigns on Facebook,
    Twitter, LinkedIn and Google+ distributed highly sharable imagery that continually
    reinforced the brand’s identity and expertise, by providing free ideas of genuine
    value.

  title: Recreating a conference, online
  link: 
  description: The yearly teachSTEP conference, accessed entirely online, was a breakthrough
    for teachers who lacked the funds or time to travel to an international gathering.
    Crafted to provide a best-in-class delegate experience, the conference enjoyed
    attendance levels comparable to the industry mainstays.
