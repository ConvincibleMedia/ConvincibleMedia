  subtitle: Photoshopping
  title: Digitally transforming regular snaps into high-end photography
  link: 
  description: Snaps taken in-house provide a stream of up-close, day-to-day images
    that would be hard to orchestrate (and expensive) with traditional scheduled photoshoots.
    We take the best shots and, through the magic of Photoshop, make them seem like
    highly-staged big-budget photographs. These form the heart of the Bistro's social
    media content, showing off their food, wine and ambience.
