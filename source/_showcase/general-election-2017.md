intro:
- item_type: block_body_lead
  paragraphs: Virgil Ierubino (Owner at Convincible) ran the Green Party’s General
    Election campaign in Cambridge in 2017, catapulting the party’s mindshare among
    the electorate.

  text: Even with a miracle, winning was off the cards for a small party in 2017.
    Being realistic about this allowed us to focus the goal toward communication,
    and so to direct our energy appropriately. Ensuring every voter knew the Greens
    were a serious option was an enormous milestone.

  title: Making every leaflet worth ten
  link: 
  description: Leaflets are the core of a political campaign. With the Greens – who
    send an order of magnitude fewer than other parties – every item needs to have
    10 times the impact. We had just a few weeks to design and deliver over 90,000
    leaflets, but we gave each one the full treatment.

  title: 8 weeks where every second counted
  link: 
  description: Elections are time sensitive – especially when in 2017 a Snap Election
    was called with just 8 weeks from announcement to polling day. Constant and clear
    communication was key to maintaining a tight ship, motivating an army of volunteers,
    and getting maximum value from PR opportunities in the local and national news.

  subtitle: Video Production
  title: Engaging emotions with narrative
  link: 
  description: We produced, filmed and edited a ‘hero video’ featuring the MP candidate,
    which became the centrepiece of the digital campaign. Alongside this we produced
    a series of short, sharp animations designed solely for social media sharing.

  title: One concept to rule the campaign
  link: 
  description: With such a short time-frame, and so much political noise, we needed
    a simple, central concept to reinforce with every touchpoint. “It’s time for action”
    was emphasised with the visual metaphor of Big Ben striking ‘Green’, reinforcing
    the party’s serious contention for Parliament.

  subtitle: Copywriting
  title: Getting across ideas in just a glance
  link: 
  description: Political copy has a reputation for being dry. It’s also got a reputation
    for going straight in the bin. We needed to cut through the mounds of leaflets
    piling up on every voters’ doorstep. We did this through striking visuals, bold
    and simple headlines, and succinct wording that gets the point across even if
    you only glance.

  subtitle: Social Media
  title: Spreading the word virally
  link: 
  description: Facebook allowed us to maintain contact with supportive voters throughout
    the campaign. We garnered thousands of likes, comments and shares, which served
    to spread the message – at zero cost. This was bolstered with a hyper-targeted
    advertising campaign that made optimal use of donated funds.

  paragraphs: The quality of this election campaign, in such a short timeframe, was
    down to Virgil's fantastic drive and organisation.
