  text: Even with a miracle, winning was off the cards for a small party in 2017.
    Being realistic about this allowed us to focus the goal toward communication,
    and so to direct our energy appropriately. Ensuring every voter knew the Greens
    were a serious option was an enormous milestone.

  description: Leaflets are the core of a political campaign. With the Greens – who
    send an order of magnitude fewer than other parties – every item needs to have
    10 times the impact. We had just a few weeks to design and deliver over 90,000
    leaflets, but we gave each one the full treatment.
