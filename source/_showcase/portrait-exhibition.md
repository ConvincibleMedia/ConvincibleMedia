  text: The exhibition, entitled *Self-Reflection \ The Portrait & Its Uses*, explored
    portraiture as an artform over time, and showcased original artefacts of both
    national and local significance, including a larger-than-life painting of Napoleon
    I, and poignant photos from the 1870s of prisoners from the local gaol.

    being explored through the elements of the exhibition. We then laid out the artefacts,
    panels and supporting text (which we rewrote for clarity and impact) to create
