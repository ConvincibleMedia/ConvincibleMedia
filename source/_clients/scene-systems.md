Scene Systems was an innovative technology startup that operated out of Silicon Fen from 1999–2016. They disrupted the market for forensic animation – animated reconstructions of events used in US court cases – with a technology that could produce these faster and cheaper than ever before.

Virgil Ierubino (Managing Director at Convincible) worked with Scene Systems from 2008–2009, managing marketing strategy and campaigns.
