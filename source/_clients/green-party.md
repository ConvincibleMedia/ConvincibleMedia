The Green Party is a national political party in the UK with policies focused on fairness and sustainability.

We recognise that the Greens may not be a party that all our customers like or agree with. However, we didn't want to hide our good work with them. Convincible does not endorse the Green Party and is not a political business. We do not promote any particular party beyond the specific projects where we've been engaged to do so.

**You won't find politics influencing your projects with us in any way.**
