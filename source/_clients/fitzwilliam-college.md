Fitzwilliam College is a dynamic, welcoming and international community committed to developing the talents of all its students, numbering some 750 (including postgraduates). One of the 31 colleges of the University, it was founded in 1869 specifically to broaden access to Cambridge.

Virgil Ierubino (Managing Director at Convincible) worked with Fitzwilliam College in 2009 to redevelop their website and web strategy.
