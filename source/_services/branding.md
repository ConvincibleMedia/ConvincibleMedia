        Literally any point of interaction between you and your audience is a 'touchpoint': not just the sign outside your door, but the back of a receipt, the feel of a desk.

        The principle of 360° Branding applies your brand design and values to every touchpoint – to perfectly orchestrate the customer experience.

        It's long been established that winning new customers is 5× more expensive than keeping existing ones. So give customers an experience they can't get anywhere else.
